# The Beginners Guide to Google Summer of Code (GSoC)

## Introduction
This is the beginners guide to Google Summer of Code (GSoC). The Google Summer of Code is an annual global program sponsored and managed by Google. The program focuses of bringing more student developers into open source project development. In this program the students work with an Open source organization under the guidance of mentors (selected organization members) on a 3 month programming project in Summers.


## Motivation
It all started with a blog post. I was writing a blog post "the beginners guide to GSoC" to help various students (who otherwise reach us on various social media platforms to ask queries and for the students of NITH and IIITU) get all the information and resources at one place. Then I thought to create this repo so that other knowledgeable people can also contribute and to maximize its reach.
Me and the other collaborators of this repo are all two times(2019, 2018) Successful GSoC students from NITH and IIITU. So, we'll try to provide accurate, to the point and as much information as we can.

## What is Open Source
The term Open Source means the source code of the software is freely available to its users and anyone can modify it. Open Source softwares can also be redistributed after modifying the original software. The Open Source softwares are usually available to the users for free, these softwares have no licensing fee or other restrictions as they use [open source licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_license). To know the detailed definition of Open Source you can visit this [link - opensource.org](https://opensource.org/osd).

Few examples of open source softwares which you might be using on a daily basis are:

* [Mozilla Firefox web browser](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) -  It has 665,020 commits made by 7,369 contributors representing 20,505,182 lines of code. [Reference](https://www.openhub.net/p/firefox)
* [VLC media player](https://www.videolan.org/index.html) - It has 82,544 commits made by 524 contributors and has 50 releases. [Reference](https://github.com/videolan/vlc)
* Almost all the Linux distributions. [Reference](http://glug.nith.ac.in/getting-started)

### Why Should we Care
**Why Should we care if a software is open source?**

As the source code of open source softwares is freely available. Then there is negligible chance that the software is not respecting the user privacy. Which means that the software can't do something like this [These 6 popular browser extensions are selling your data](https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/popular-browser-extensions-are-selling-your-data/) and this [Uninstall These Eight Browser Extensions That Stole Data from Millions](https://lifehacker.com/uninstall-these-eight-browser-extensions-that-stole-dat-1836539093).

But this does not mean that open source softwares are more secure than the closed source softwares. As in case of open source, the code is freely available so the threat actor can easily find vulnerabilities in it, when compared to the same software being closed source. But almost all of the popular open source softwares are being developed by the "best of the brains" on the earth, so worry not. 

There is another reason we should care about these softwares, as most of these softwares are created and maintained by developers who don't get paid for anything or organizations which rely on donations to keep their projects alive. These softwares are not created for the purpose of earning money and making profits rather they are created to help/ease the lives of other people. To understand this better you should have a look at the [History of Firefox](https://itsfoss.com/history-of-firefox/).

The Open source projects benefit users in the way that they are free, can be modified and re distributed (but to modify any software one should know it better, not everyone can modify a software), provides flexibility. These projects also benefit large corporations eg. Microsoft edge is based on Chromium and open source browser. These corporations can use the source code of open source softwares without any restrictions or license issues. 

### How to make a contribution
Contributing to open source helps the contributor learn and gain experience about the language, product OR skill. But before trying to contribute to open source you have to learn few skills which are very easy. E.g. git, github, a programming language (not necessary, but essential for GSoC aspirants), basic knowledge of IRC(Internet Relay Chat), Basic knowledge of Bug tracking tools.

[Reference to learn about git and github](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners)

The best way to contribute to an open source project is by getting to know the project and then finding a mentor (who may be an existing contributor to the project). The mentor will help to know the project better and will guide you through the project i.e. which bugs you should work on, how to fix a particular bug, how to submit your patch <sup>[1]</sup> (following the organization contribution guidelines). Working with a mentor will help you a lot. And if your mentor belongs to an organization that gets selected for GSoC, then you'll have an edge over other participants who are trying to get into GSoC.

If you are unable to find a mentor then you have to join the project community which can be on IRC(Internet Relay Chat), Slack, Gitter, etc. For Example the project community of [The Libreswan Project](https://libreswan.org/wiki/IRC) is on IRC. Then you can ask question there related to the project or organization. But don't ask too obvious question. By Obvious question I mean the question which can be easily answered by reading about the project on the organization website or project README.md. E.g. "What does this project do?".

Once there you could ask questions related to bugs for beginners, etc. Usually the organization members take time to respond to such questions. So, after asking the question wait for 24-48 hours (Keeping in mind the timezone difference).

Once you reach there start working on solving the easy bug OR bugs for beginners and submit your patch (or pull request).

**If you want to make your first contribution without getting involved with the organization members then there is a way.**

You can find various such repositories on gitHub or GitLab with a simple web search.
